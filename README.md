# rhocube
Compute 3D density models, and integrate over dz, creating a 2D map.

In the case of optically thin emission, this 2D density map is
proportional to the brightness map.  Ideal for fitting, e.g. observed
images of LBV shells, supernova remnants, and many more.

Many model geometries provided (see [rhocube.ipynb][./rhocube.ipynb]`
and [models.py][./models.py]).
